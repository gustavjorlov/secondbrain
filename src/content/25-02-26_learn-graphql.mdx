# learn graphql

A smooth onboarding process for teams new to GraphQL and federation requires a structured approach. Here’s a step-by-step plan:

1. Establish a Learning Pathway

Before jumping into federation, ensure team members understand GraphQL fundamentals.
* Basic GraphQL Training:
* Assign interactive courses (e.g., Apollo Odyssey, HowToGraphQL).
* Encourage hands-on practice using Apollo Sandbox or GraphQL Playground.
* Run internal workshops on writing queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
* Schema Design Principles:
* Teach best practices for designing GraphQL schemas (e.g., structuring types, avoiding over-fetching).
* Cover patterns like unions, interfaces, and input types.

2. Hands-on with Apollo Server
* Have teams build a small GraphQL server with Apollo Server.
* Practice implementing resolvers, handling authentication, and integrating with REST APIs.

3. Introduce GraphQL Federation
* Explain federation concepts: subgraphs, the gateway, and entity relationships.
* Conduct hands-on labs where teams create subgraphs and compose them into a federated schema.
* Encourage small proof-of-concept projects before migrating production services.

4. Define Team Responsibilities in a Federated GraphQL Setup
* Clarify who owns which subgraphs.
* Establish governance for schema evolution and versioning.
* Set up tooling (Apollo Studio, Rover CLI) for schema validation and composition checks.

5. Foster a Learning Culture
* Host GraphQL office hours for Q&A sessions.
* Create a shared knowledge base with best practices and troubleshooting tips.
* Encourage cross-team pairing and code reviews to spread GraphQL knowledge.

6. Support Migration Efforts
* Identify an initial set of APIs to migrate as learning exercises.
* Provide templates for common use cases (e.g., authentication, error handling).
* Ensure monitoring and performance tracking with Apollo metrics.
