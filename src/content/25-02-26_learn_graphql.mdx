# learn graphql

A smooth onboarding process for teams new to GraphQL and federation requires a structured approach. Here’s a step-by-step plan:

1. Establish a Learning Pathway

Before jumping into federation, ensure team members understand GraphQL fundamentals.
	•	Basic GraphQL Training:
	•	Assign interactive courses (e.g., Apollo Odyssey, HowToGraphQL).
	•	Encourage hands-on practice using Apollo Sandbox or GraphQL Playground.
	•	Run internal workshops on writing queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
	•	Schema Design Principles:
	•	Teach best practices for designing GraphQL schemas (e.g., structuring types, avoiding over-fetching).
	•	Cover patterns like unions, interfaces, and input types.

2. Hands-on with Apollo Server
	•	Have teams build a small GraphQL server with Apollo Server.
	•	Practice implementing resolvers, handling authentication, and integrating with REST APIs.

3. Introduce GraphQL Federation
	•	Explain federation concepts: subgraphs, the gateway, and entity relationships.
	•	Conduct hands-on labs where teams create subgraphs and compose them into a federated schema.
	•	Encourage small proof-of-concept projects before migrating production services.

4. Define Team Responsibilities in a Federated GraphQL Setup
	•	Clarify who owns which subgraphs.
	•	Establish governance for schema evolution and versioning.
	•	Set up tooling (Apollo Studio, Rover CLI) for schema validation and composition checks.

5. Foster a Learning Culture
	•	Host GraphQL office hours for Q&A sessions.
	•	Create a shared knowledge base with best practices and troubleshooting tips.
	•	Encourage cross-team pairing and code reviews to spread GraphQL knowledge.

6. Support Migration Efforts
	•	Identify an initial set of APIs to migrate as learning exercises.
	•	Provide templates for common use cases (e.g., authentication, error handling).
	•	Ensure monitoring and performance tracking with Apollo metrics.
